## About
This repo contains several utilities for Data Science and ML Engineering work. I made
this both for personal use and for practice using AWS.

## Repository Contents
The `aws-stacks` directory contains several CloudFormation stacks as `.yml` files.
The idea is to have stacks for everyday tasks such as training an ML model, or setting
up a logging / tracking server.
